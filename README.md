### Overview
Developing an app for my Church’s Kid’s ministry. They have several events, gatherings and summer camps throughout the year. I observed a loose system on kids registration for events and gatherings. I want to implement a system that allows parents first to login into the app and register their children for events 

Another problem is resources are unknown and underutilized. So I want to categorize resources and put a mechanism for searching resources per their age group and also a platform for parents to purchase resources using the app.

Also to have a data base for saving the information of the kids attending, username (it could be an email) and passwords of parents and event organizers, data base of resources.

### Features
• This website will help church members to closely follow the different events kid's ministry plans on doing through out the year. It shows them list of events, events time and events resources. 

• It further allows users to sign in to the website with their user name and password and buy resources, sign up for events and volunteer in the events. And if the user is an admin, it will enable him/her to add or delete events.

•	Html Forms submission: For creating events, signing up to events and volunteering in events.

•	Save and querying database through usernames, emails and resources
